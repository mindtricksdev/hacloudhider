# Home Assistant Cloud Hider

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

A simple HACS frontend integration that hides the "Home Assistant Cloud" menu item from your Home Assistant sidebar.

## Why?

If you prefer not to see the Home Assistant Cloud option in your sidebar menu, this integration will cleanly hide it from view while keeping all other functionality intact.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Automatically hides the "Home Assistant Cloud" menu item
- ‚úÖ Works across all Home Assistant pages and navigation
- ‚úÖ Handles dynamic sidebar updates and route changes
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and efficient
- ‚úÖ No configuration needed

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to "Frontend" section
3. Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/mindtricksdev/hacloudhider`
6. Select "Frontend" as the category
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Home Assistant Cloud Hider" in the list and click "Download"
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `cloud_hider.js` file from the latest release
2. Copy it to your `config/www/` directory
3. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  extra_module_url:
    - /local/cloud_hider.js
```

4. Restart Home Assistant

## How it Works

The integration uses a lightweight JavaScript module that:

1. Monitors the DOM for the Home Assistant Cloud menu item
2. Hides it using CSS `display: none`
3. Continues to monitor for navigation changes and sidebar updates
4. Re-hides the element if it reappears during dynamic updates

The script is designed to be efficient and only runs the hiding logic when necessary.

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Home Assistant 2023.1+
- ‚úÖ All modern browsers
- ‚úÖ Works with custom themes
- ‚úÖ Compatible with other frontend integrations

## Troubleshooting

### The Cloud menu item still appears

- Ensure you've restarted Home Assistant after installation
